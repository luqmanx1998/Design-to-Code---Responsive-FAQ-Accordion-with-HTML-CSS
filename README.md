# FAQ Accordion - Responsive with HTML/CSS Only!

![DESIGN-IMG](design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This FAQ Accordion challenge was a small and rather simple one, in the sense that it didn't require as much CSS and layouts, like some of the other full landing pages I've done. However, I was tempted to try it out anyways, as I knew it would be a test of my HTML and functional CSS skills ! This challenge was meant to be done with Javascript, but I knew it could be done with only HTML and CSS, and I gave it a go ! This was also a free challenge, meaning I did not have access to a Figma file this time around, and had to practice eye-balling the dimensions !

## Challenges Faced

- **Functional CSS:** 
  As I mentioned, this challenge was meant to be done with Javascript, but I knew it could be accomplished with just HTML and CSS, with a few tricks. I was aware that I could use the 'checkbox method' in order to accomplish this, utilising `input type="checkbox"`, `label for`, and the `:checked:` pseudo-class, in order to simulate click events ! That being said, it's my first time actually using this trick on my own, so I had to take my time with it, and I'm happy with the end result !

- **Background Positioning:** 
  I had some issues trying to get the background image to properly scale with with the viewport as I tested for responsiveness, in the end, with a few tweaks using `background-size`, I managed to get it done.

## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Responsive Design** 
- **Problem-Solving:** Drawing on previous project experience to solve new challenges.
